This script is an example of inserting data into the database via a submission. The script recieves POST data from
a seperate front end page. It trims the data and validates it before making an entry in to the database to ensure data integrity. I didn't develop
the code for the uploading of the image, that was done by a nother member. However i incooprated a transaction that
ensure all of the data is incooprated or none of the data is inccoporated. This page adds the functionality to the upload
page and without it no data would be stored in the database breaking other crucial functions within the project.
