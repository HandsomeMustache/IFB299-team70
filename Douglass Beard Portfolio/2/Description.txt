This script is an example of one of the include scripts. THis script interacts with the database pulling a list of all the users uploaded
textbooks. On the top of the html front end this script is included and with the information recieved is outputted by the page it is include in.
The goal of this script was to seperate as much of the backend from front end as possible. Although the front end script still needs php coding,
by seperating scripts it helps categorize how the script interacts with the project.
