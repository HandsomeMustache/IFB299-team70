Team Contribution Artifacts

across all pages using a javascript function. This allowed the nav bar to be updated
independently of the webpages it was being used on. 

2. Web pages: Included signup.php page where the user signs up for bookhunters, upload book page, 
the textbook list page, single book page and a phpmailertest page to prototype the 
mailing function for our webpage.
